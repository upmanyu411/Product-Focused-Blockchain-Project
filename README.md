# ðŸ’¸ Stablecoin-Based Cross-Border Payment Simulation

A self-initiated fintech project simulating a cross-border merchant payment gateway using stablecoins (USDC) on the Ethereum testnet, with wallet integration, blockchain settlement, and regulatory awareness.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

This project explores how blockchain-based stablecoins like USDC can be used for secure, fast, and compliant cross-border payments. Inspired by real-world merchant needs, I simulated a simplified payment experience with key components from user transaction to blockchain settlement.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Simulate a **merchant crypto payment flow** using Ethereum testnet.
- Integrate **Metamask wallet** for user interaction.
- Implement **USDC-based transactions** with a focus on user experience.
- Understand **gas optimization** and **transaction finality**.
- Explore **blockchain APIs** (e.g., Etherscan) for payment tracking.
- Evaluate **AML/KYC** implications for stablecoin payments in India, Singapore, and the US.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Blockchain:** Ethereum Testnet (Goerli or Sepolia)
- **Wallet:** Metamask
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (basic interaction)
- **Frontend (Optional):** HTML/CSS + Web3.js
- **APIs:** Etherscan, CoinGecko
- **Tools:** Remix IDE, Ganache, VSCode

---

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Understood the **transaction lifecycle** on Ethereum.
- Designed a **user-friendly payment simulation** mimicking real merchant flow.
- Integrated public APIs to simulate live payment dashboards.
- Analyzed **regulatory friction** and payment performance vs. traditional rails.

---

## ðŸ“· Screenshots (Optional)

_Add screenshots of Metamask integration, simulated transaction, Etherscan explorer view, etc._

---

## ðŸ“š Future Work

- Add multi-chain support (e.g., Polygon or Solana)
- Include backend logic for payment confirmation
- Compare algorithmic stablecoins like DAI
- Build UX dashboard for merchants
